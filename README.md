This lab demonstrates how I deployed a Blazor web application to Azure App Service and enabled full observability using Application Insightsâ€”without modifying the application code. I configured autoinstrumentation at the service level, allowing Azure to collect telemetry data such as failed requests, server response times, and availability metrics.

# Blazor Web App
Web App with:
- Runtime: .NET 8 (LTS)
- OS: Windows
